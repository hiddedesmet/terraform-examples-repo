# Design Decision: Single Module vs Two Modules

## Summary

Both approaches work well, but the choice depends on your specific requirements and use case.

## Detailed Comparison

| Aspect | Single Module | Two Modules |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Complexity** | ✅ Simple structure | ⚠️ More complex structure |
| **Maintenance** | ✅ All networking in one place | ⚠️ Need to manage dependencies |
| **Reusability** | ❌ Limited reusability | ✅ High reusability |
| **Flexibility** | ❌ Hard to extend | ✅ Very flexible |
| **Existing VNets** | ❌ Cannot add to existing VNets | ✅ Can add subnets to any VNet |
| **Testing** | ⚠️ Must test everything together | ✅ Can test components separately |
| **Learning Curve** | ✅ Easier to understand | ⚠️ Requires understanding module dependencies |
| **Code Duplication** | ✅ No duplication | ✅ No duplication (good design) |
| **State Management** | ✅ Single state for network | ⚠️ Multiple resources in state |

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use Single Module When:
- ✅ Building greenfield projects
- ✅ Network requirements are well-defined and stable
- ✅ Team prefers simplicity over flexibility
- ✅ All subnets will always be created together
- ✅ You're working on smaller projects or prototypes

### Use Two Modules When:
- ✅ Working in enterprise environments
- ✅ Need to add subnets to existing VNets
- ✅ Different teams manage VNets and subnets
- ✅ Requirements change frequently
- ✅ Need maximum flexibility and reusability
- ✅ Building a library of reusable modules
- ✅ Want to follow microservices-like architecture principles

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Development Environment
**Recommendation: Single Module**
- Simple, predictable networking needs
- Quick setup and teardown
- Less complexity preferred

### Scenario 2: Production Enterprise Environment
**Recommendation: Two Modules**
- Network teams manage VNets
- Application teams need to add subnets
- Compliance and governance requirements
- Need to integrate with existing infrastructure

### Scenario 3: Multi-tenant SaaS Platform
**Recommendation: Two Modules**
- Need to dynamically create subnets for tenants
- Existing VNet infrastructure
- Complex networking requirements

## Best Practices for Either Approach

### For Single Module:
1. Keep the subnet configuration flexible with `for_each`
2. Include comprehensive validation
3. Document clearly what subnets are expected
4. Consider future requirements

### For Two Modules:
1. Design clear interfaces between modules
2. Use proper dependency management (`depends_on`)
3. Make subnet module generic and reusable
4. Document the relationship between modules clearly

## Conclusion

**For most production scenarios, I recommend the two-module approach** because:

1. **Future-proof**: You can always add more subnets later
2. **Reusable**: Subnet module can be used with any VNet
3. **Separation of concerns**: Network and subnet management can be separated
4. **Enterprise-ready**: Fits better with organizational boundaries

However, if you're working on simple projects or prototypes where you control the entire networking stack and don't expect much change, the single module approach is perfectly valid and will be easier to work with.
